# Marah`s notes about Passport for Open Science.

### What I learn it ?

1- Different types of resources for academic research.

2- A DMP is an ongoing document which needs to be created before data collection
begins and updated throughout your research project.

3- The General Data Protection Regulation.

4- Think. Check. Submit website to help you assess the reliability of the journal that you would like to publish in it .

5-  Peer review is carried out in two stages which reduces the effect
of publication bias.

### I found this interesting .

1- A thesis that is more widely disseminated is much better protected against
plagiarism than a work with more restricted dissemination.

2- The French National Research Agency (ANR) a The ANR now stipulates 
that funding will only be allocated if the principles of open
science are respected including full and immediate access to publications.
