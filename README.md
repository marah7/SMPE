### Homeworks Week 1

## Tasks


- [✅] **Read Popper's text**
- [✅] **Indicate your name on the [Pad](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/Dai2ZzqzTwezOMZVIyMN-g#)**. You will use to collaborate and fill in all the information you can.
- [✅] **Register on the [Mattermost](https://framateam.org/smpe-2023-2024/channels/town-square) through this [invitation link](https://framateam.org/signup_user_complete/?id=yxk5rpuqdpds5b785t6ka94o4e&md=link&sbr=su)**. This is the preferred communication mode.
- [✅] Set up a *public* [**GitHub**](https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject) or [**GitLab**](https://gitlab.com/yourusername/yourproject) project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.
- [✅] **Register to the [MOOC on Reproducible Research](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/recherche-reproductible-principes-methodologiques-pour-une-science-transparente/)**
- [✅] **Follow modules 1 + 2 of the MOOC** with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on /Challenger/; watching interviews is optional)
- [✅] Set up a computational document system (e.g., [**Rstudio**](#rstudio) or [**Jupyter**](#jupyter)) on your laptop or through the [**UGA JupyterHub**](https://jupyterhub.u-ga.fr/).
- [✅] **Report the URL of your git project, your Mattermost ID on the [Pad](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/Dai2ZzqzTwezOMZVIyMN-g#)**.

### Homeworks Week 2

## Tasks


- [✅] **Start learning R by reading [this R crash course for computer scientists](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2022_10_Grenoble/R_crash_course.html) and [Rmd sources](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2022_10_Grenoble/R_crash_course.Rmd):**
- [✅] Criticize every figure of Jean-Marc’s slides by: Applying the checklist for good graphics; Proposing a better representation (hand-drawing is fine) that passes the checklist.
- [✅] Report this work for at least 3 figures on you github/gitlab project.
- [✅] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (Challenger). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space.

### Homeworks Week 3

## Tasks
- [⚠️] Use good naming and organization conventions in your repos.
- [✅] Complete the Challenger exercise if you haven’t done so.
- [✅] Engage in module 3 of the MOOC and choose a topic for the peer evaluation (final task of module 3).
- [⚠️] Here is an opportunity to practice your data curation/analysisskills by producing the First name/last name analysis in a computational document. I encourage you to use dplyr and ggplot for this analysis.
